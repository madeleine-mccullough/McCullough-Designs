                <p>My name is Madeleine McCullough, I am a Graphic Design student at the University of Colorado Denver. I was born and raised Grapevine Texas. In 2015 I attended the University of Oklahoma where I studied Journalism, however I soon learned this was not my passion. My educational journey lead me to Denver Colorado in 2018. I began my journey in Graphic Design at Front Range Community College and the University of Colorado Denver. I always knew I wanted to be an artist. My passion and dedication to my creative side has driven me to become the artist I am today. My networking skills have opened up many amazing opportunities along the way. I jump on every opportunity to learn and grow my artistic skills and portfolio. I have experience working with Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Acrobat, CSS and HTML. I enjoy taking every opportunity to grow my skills in package design, branding, web design, and advertising. Outside of design I love to paint, draw, hike, take photos, go to concerts, try new foods, and travel. All of these passions fuel my growth and inspire me to keep creating.</p>
